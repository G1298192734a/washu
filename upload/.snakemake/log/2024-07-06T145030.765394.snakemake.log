    * Mixed rules and functions in same snakefile.:
      Small one-liner functions used only once should be defined as lambda
      expressions. Other functions should be collected in a common module, e.g.
      'rules/common.smk'. This makes the workflow steps more readable.

    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In
      distributed environments, this means that errors are harder to discover. In
      local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become
      unreadable.

    * Migrate long run directives into scripts or notebooks:
      Long run directives hamper workflow readability. Use the script or notebook
      direcive instead. Note that the script or notebook directive does not
      involve boilerplate. Similar to run, you will have direct access to params,
      input, output, and wildcards.Only use the run direcive for a handful of
      lines.
